[8:25:46 PM] Quickstreamingmedia @StreamingHelp: Tested i am tired from this. found those things they was not ok:
Navigation bar its displayed again on live tv. 
Navigating through playlist the highlighted channel not moving so we dont know where we are. 
Film kids category there is displayed whole movie name Like Mov Kids then movie name, it should be displayed only movie name without mov kids.. Like other categories. 
To live tv playlist looks good but it will be better if you add one more channel in row, on every row from left to the right now are displayed 3 channel, make it please 4 channels to be displayed.
And playlist from movies make it like it was with big icon so we can see movies icons, something bigger icons please.
